## Introduction

Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I learnt how to build a Full Stack MERN Application - from start to finish. 
The App is called "Experiences" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
